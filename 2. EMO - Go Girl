PG 2 Synopsis
VERSE 1
BAR 1 “Found you at a crossroads, a rail road to be more specific.” I just imagined myself somewhere in the UK meeting a gal who just got cheated on. 
BAR 2 “Baby why are you cryin' why are you cryin’ cryin’.” I’d imagine myself acting the nice guy.”
BAR 3 “Found you at this rail road, why are you' cryin’ cryin’.” Just stressing the lyric. 
VERSE 2
BAR 4 “…you go girl, an, walk talk, with me.” I’ imagined myself asking her to go for a walk & talk with me. 
BAR 5 “Found you at this rail road lookin' so sad & a pretty.” Telling her I think she looks pretty, more than that, she is pretty.
BAR 6 “How about you and me go thrifting, driftin' in this thing.” I imagined I had a car in this song. Shorties love thriftin’ and driftin’!
BAR 7 “Found you at this cross road just for you, you & me.” Just stressing and reminding her she be crying.”
BAR 8 “…you go girl, an, walk walk, with me.” In reference to go on a walk with ‘god’ and maybe so much more ‘faith.’
BRIDGE ON OCTAVE FOR _16x4_ COUNTS
BRIDGE 2
BAR 9 “Found you at this same rail road lookin' so sad & a pretty.” Few years later we’re back at the rail road. 
BAR 10 “Whitz about you & me ever lasting either.” I really just wanted a play date, a play mate that day. 
BAR 11 “Lately lady, you’re so pretty with the way you walk talk with me.” But lately, she’s so damn beautiful.
BAR 12 “I might just might have have to ask you have to have ask to marry me.” Basically asking the character is asking her to marry him.”
DROP OFF
BAR 13 “I said!” Stressing’ the call of matter. 
BAR 14 “Look at me, look at me, look at me.” Stressing’ it even more.
BAR 15 “I say!”Sressing’ the same feeling at a different degree. 
BAR 16 “Look at me, look at me, in my eyes.” They have to look at each other in the eyes for the sake of romance I guess…
CLIFF
BAR 17 “You’re the woman I see, the woman I see, in my life.” Supposedly. 
BAR 18 “You’re the woman that I need in my life, yeah I need in my life.” Supposedly.
