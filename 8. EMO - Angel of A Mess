PG2 Lyric Definition 
0:05 - 0:20
Could have been, my girlfriend, yuo could've my girlfriend (little baby it has to end.)
yuo could have been, the only one, my only one (my biggest fan)
could of been what you could've been but you're weighing down my angel consciousonsess (stupid witch)
could of been what you should've been what you could've been what yuo shoudld've been (my babe)
0:21 - 0:43
I’ll play, pretend I'm the angel for you to like me
Could have been, 6:00am
You were weighing down my a-consciousness, my a-consciousness. (I’m an angel of a mess.)
You could have been the one for Ree, only one for Ree, only one for me.
0:43 - 0:46
Oh no, not again.
0:46 - 1:08
Could’nt of been my girlfriend, my spider-queen, my only queen. 
Could’nt of been the only one for you, for you and me, you and me. 
Could’nt of been my remedy, to all these things, all of the things. 
Could’nt of been the only one for ree, the only one for ree. 
(I hate my life.)
1:09 - 1:29
I promise there’s nothing about us. Deserves exist!
You hate it when you’re on there my camera. You stupid bitch. 
You hate it when i’m on there, their cameras. I prayed for this riff! 
Baby. Baby i’m so sorry you could’ve been. 
1:30 - 1:51
I’ll play pretend, I’m the bully, for you to please block me babe please block me babe. 
You were weighing down my angel of a head, i’m an angel for a head. AREN’T YOU FROM HELL. 
Could have been the only one for Ree, only one for me. Just you us me.
But lady please, lay for me, please lay for me, don’t leave today.
